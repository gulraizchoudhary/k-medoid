#This implementation is based on strsimÂ library in python
#-The library also contains the many other similarity measures such as edit distance etc. 
#https://pypi.org/project/strsim/#optimal-string-alignment

#Longest Common Subsequence
#The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem consists in finding the longest subsequence common to two (or more) sequences. 
#It differs from problems of finding common substrings: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.
#
#It is used by the diff utility, by Git for reconciling multiple changes, etc.

#The LCS distance between strings X (of length n) and Y (of length m) is n + m - 2 |LCS(X, Y)| min = 0 max = n + m
